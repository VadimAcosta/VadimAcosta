## Project Samples

[Using Department of Labor (USDL) Employment Projections for Applications in Marketing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASMtLczRQfQ&t=35s)
* Investigated if government employment projections are accurate enough for marketing applications
* Queried and managed data in SQL, calculated the figures in Excel and presented insights in PowerPoint
* Determined that 90% of USDL 3-year employment projections are over 90% accurate and advocated for their use in planning marketing campaigns on local and regional levels

[Olist Customer Lifetime Value Modeling and Prediction](https://github.com/VadimAcosta/capstone_3_brazil/blob/master/brazil_olist_capstone3.pdf)
* Examined which Brazilian Olist customers are most likely to contribute more to revenue over lifetime
* Analyzed Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist and modeled profits using Python Pandas
* Determined that customers who spend less per purchase tend to be repeat customers resulting in higher customer lifetime values and recommended adjusting marketing to better cater to low income users

[Airbnb Price Model as a Function of Distance from Landmark / Population Center](https://github.com/VadimAcosta/airbnb/blob/master/airbnb_pesentation_110819.pdf)
* Built a model to predict prices Airbnb accommodations based on GPS coordinates
* Cleaned data in SQL, performed calculations in Excel and created visualizations in Tableau
* Quantified relationships between coordinates and price using linear and polynomial regression to model price of accommodations as a function of distance from landmarks
